Type	Description	Languages/Technologies	Real-World Example
Frontend	The visual part of a website that users see and interact with.	HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue	The buttons, colors, and layout you see on Amazon’s homepage.
Backend	The server-side part that handles logic, data storage, and communication with the database.	Node.js, Express, Python (Django/Flask), PHP, Java	When you click “Login” on a site, the backend checks your credentials in the database.
Full Stack	A developer who works on both frontend and backend.	Combination of frontend + backend tools	A developer building an entire app like a food delivery site — designing pages and managing orders/data.



2. Simple Diagram: Client-Server Model
+-------------+           Request (HTTP)           +-----------------+
|             | ---------------------------------> |                 |
|   Browser   |                                    |    Web Server   |
|  (Client)   | <--------------------------------- |                 |
+-------------+           Response (HTML)          +-----------------+


Explanation:

The client (browser) sends a request (like typing www.google.com).

The server processes the request and sends back the page content (HTML/CSS/JS).



3. How a Browser Requests and Displays a Web Page

Step-by-Step Process:

You type a URL (e.g., www.example.com) in the browser.

The browser contacts the DNS server to find the IP address of that domain.

It sends an HTTP request to the web server at that IP address.

The web server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the HTML.

The browser parses the HTML, downloads CSS, JS, and images.

The rendering engine builds and displays the final web page visually.


4. Tools Required to Set Up a Web Development Environment
Tool	Purpose
VS Code	Code editor for writing HTML, CSS, JS, and backend code.
Web Browser (Chrome/Firefox)	To view and test your web pages.
Node.js & npm	For running JavaScript outside the browser and managing packages.
Git & GitHub	For version control and storing your projects online.
Live Server Extension	Instantly reloads your webpage when you make changes.


5. What is a Web Server?

A web server is software or hardware that serves web pages to users upon request.
It receives HTTP requests and sends back HTTP responses.

Examples:

Apache HTTP Server

Nginx

Microsoft IIS

Node.js (using Express)

LiteSpeed


6. Roles in a Web Development Project
Role	Responsibilities
Frontend Developer	Builds user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; ensures responsive design and usability.
Backend Developer	Handles logic, APIs, authentication, and communication with the database.
Database Administrator (DBA)	Designs, maintains, and secures the database; ensures backups and performance tuning.


7. Install VS Code and Configure for HTML, CSS, and JS

Steps:

Download VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com
.

Install Extensions:

Live Server (for preview)

Prettier (for code formatting)

HTML CSS Support

JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets

Create a folder → open it in VS Code → make files:

index.html

style.css

script.js

Right-click index.html → Open with Live Server.

📸 (Take a screenshot of VS Code showing your files and open webpage for submission.)


8. Difference between Static and Dynamic Websites
Type	Description	Example
Static Website	Same content for every visitor; built with only HTML, CSS, JS.	A portfolio website with fixed pages.
Dynamic Website	Content changes based on user interaction or data. Uses backend + database.	Facebook, YouTube, or an e-commerce site showing personalized results.


9. Five Web Browsers and Their Rendering Engines
Browser	Rendering Engine	Description
Google Chrome	Blink	Fast and modern, based on Chromium.
Mozilla Firefox	Gecko	Open-source and flexible.
Safari	WebKit	Optimized for Apple devices.
Microsoft Edge	Blink (formerly EdgeHTML)	Built on Chromium base for compatibility.
Opera	Blink	Lightweight with built-in VPN and ad blocker.


10. Basic Web Architecture Flow (Diagram)
+-------------+       HTTP Request       +-------------+        SQL Query        +-------------+
|   Browser   | -----------------------> |   Web Server | ---------------------> |   Database  |
|  (Client)   | <----------------------- |   (Backend)  | <--------------------- |   (DB)      |
+-------------+       HTTP Response      +-------------+        Data Response    +-------------+
                        |
                        |  ↕ (Optional)
                        v
                  +-------------+
                  |     APIs    |
                  | (3rd Party) |
                  +-------------+


Flow Summary:

The client sends requests via the browser.

The server handles logic and communicates with the database.

APIs may fetch external data (e.g., weather, payment info).
