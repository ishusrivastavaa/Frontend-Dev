      <h2>The Art of Typography</h2>

      <p>
        <mark>Typography</mark> is the visual art of arranging type to make written language 
        readable and appealing. It involves choosing the right <strong>font family</strong>,
        setting appropriate <em>line spacing</em>, and balancing text alignment to enhance 
        the reader’s experience.
      </p>

      <p class="variation">
        Different <strong>font weights</strong> such as light, regular, and bold help create 
        hierarchy and emphasis. Similarly, <em>font size</em> and <mark>letter spacing</mark> 
        play a crucial role in improving text clarity and rhythm.
      </p>

      <p>
        In digital design, typography combines creativity with structure. 
        The first letter or the first line can often capture a reader’s attention 
        when styled uniquely — making a page feel elegant, inviting, and well-crafted.
